## Grid Search CV for Hyperparameter Tuning ##
Overview:-
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to use GridSearchCV from Scikit-Learn to find the best hyperparameters for a machine learning model.

Features:-
Uses GridSearchCV to optimize model parameters
Implements a machine learning model (e.g., Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest, etc.)
Evaluates model performance using cross-validation
Displays the best parameters and accuracy score

Requirements:-
Before running the notebook, install the required libraries using:
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib

How to Run:-
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook GridSearchCV.ipynb
Run the cells step by step to understand the process.

Output:-
The notebook will output the best hyperparameters for the selected model along with the evaluation scores.
